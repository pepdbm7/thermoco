## Requirements:

---

Firstly, you need to make sure you have Node and npm installed. You can check it with the following commands on your terminal:

- `node -v`
- `npm -v`

If you don't have them installed yet, you can install both at once on https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Before starting the front-end server, it's needed to start the back-end server first, which is dockerized, so that when we call the endpoints from the front end, we don't get an error.

## Usage:

---

Before start you need to install all the dependencies.

### `npm install`

Once installed you can start the app.

### `npm start`

## Tests

Some functionalities are covered by tests.

### `npm run test`
